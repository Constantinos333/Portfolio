        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>My professional background began outside of IT. I worked for three years in a machining shop, manufacturing
            metal components for blow moulding parts and pneumatic presses. Earlier, I also spent two months as a cadet
            on an oil tanker. These roles taught me discipline, precision, and how to work safely with complex systems.
        </p>
        <p>Since then, Iâ€™ve transitioned toward IT through help desk and content moderation work, and I am now building
            skills in networking, front-end development, and application security.</p>
